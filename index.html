I am a regular nuts-and-bolts IT guy that helps people in general do their work efficiently. While I have clients that work in mental health and similar fields, I am not an expert on any of this and I strongly encourage feedback to make sure that any (possibly inevitable) errors are corrected swiftly.

            <p class="mbr-text py-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">That being said, let's talk about what is necessary for HIPAA-compliant video chat.
<br>
<br>From a strictly technical perspective, HIPAA compliance essentially just requires encrypted one-to-one communication along with a BAA (Business Associate Agreement). While the actual requirements of building a HIPAA-compliant system from scratch are herculean, the point of the BAA is essentially your service provider is agreeing that they have already handled that themselves.
<br>
<br>That's it.</p>

    <div class="container align-left">
        <div class="media-container-column mbr-white col-md-12">
            
            <h1 class="mbr-section-title py-3 mbr-fonts-style display-1">How do I set up video chat on my computer?</h1>
            <p class="mbr-text py-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">In order to make sure that you're capable of harnessing ANY of the existing services it is important that you have the correct hardware. <strong>You will need a webcam and microphone</strong> (built into virtually every laptop sold in the past decade), and a way to listen to audio, be it headphones or speakers of some kind. 
<br>
<br>Beyond that, for the sake of skipping a thousand possible problems, you will also <strong>need your computer to be updated to the latest version of its operating system</strong>. This currently means Windows 10 (not 7, not 8, not 8.1) for PCs (if your Windows is not up to date it is very likely that it already bothers you about it. and updating is as simple as following the prompts) and MacOS 10.15+ (instructions <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/">here</a>) for those of us that run Apple hardware.
<br>
<br>In addition to that, you will need the newest version of your chosen browser. <strong>By "chosen browser" in this case I am referring to either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox</strong>. I imagine that Safari probably works very well for a lot of Apple users, but because of the way that a lot of webchat systems are developed, it is possible that Safari functionality can at times temporarily lag behind that of up-to-date versions of the aforementioned browsers. For the sake of simplicity, I suggest using one of the two for this.
<br>
<br>Beyond that, <strong>you will need to have your webcam and microphone turned on</strong>. Some laptops have a button on the top row of keys that toggles things like microphones and webcams, and some do not. If you get a message through your browser or operating system informing you that the device is "unavailable" or "nonexistent", it is possible that you may need to toggle the button if you have one. If you are using a desktop computer, this is when you might check that the webcam is plugged in and powered. If you are still confused about this, skip down to contact and I'll do my best to help you with your particular setup.
<br>
<br>It can also be a problem regarding browser permissions. <strong>Sometimes you'll see a popup that says something ominous like "This website wants access to your camera</strong>". This is actually a <strong>good thing</strong> (for one, it means your webcam is plugged in and recognized by your operating system!), and you want to<strong> click allow or confirm</strong>. People aren't really used to giving websites permission to look at their faces (which is a good instinct generally!) but in this case it is absolutely necessary for the functionality of the site. It does not constitute any sort of security threat to either you or your clients, but it is important that you only allow permission for relevant sites (eg <a href="https://doxy.me/">doxy.me</a>, <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>, etc.) and encourage others to do the same.&nbsp;<br></p>

            <p class="mbr-text py-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5"><br>I personally recommend <a href="https://doxy.me/">Doxy.me</a> as the platform for this simply because of how inexpensive it is and how simple the onboarding process is. 
<br>
<br>I would put a tutorial on how to get started on <a href="https://doxy.me/">Doxy.me</a> in particular here, but their process is wildly simple. Go to the site, click sign up for free, and follow the prompts. I would also suggest checking out their YouTube playlist that goes over a lot of the basics to get going. This should only take a couple minutes at most. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6dNAFGMSznlW4CpUtaJYljWhgybGL7W8">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6dNAFGMSznlW4CpUtaJYljWhgybGL7W8</a></p>

<br>
<br>There is no charge for this and I will do my absolute best to help every individual, but if I get swamped with a lot of requests I will try to make sure that this page is updated with as many solutions to common problems as possible to make sure that emailing me isn't necessary for as many people as possible.

<br>That being said, because it is also a dramatically slow time for me as a freelance IT geek, I am accepting donations through Venmo: @tylerasharp, Cash App $0xdeadbeef and PayPal tyleras2017@gmail.com&nbsp;</p>
